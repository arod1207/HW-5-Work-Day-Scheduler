# arod1207-HW-5-Work-Day-Scheduler
## Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.

## When a user adds an event and clicks the save icon, the event is then saved into local storage.  If the user clicks the clear all button, the local storage is emptied and the page is refreshed.

#### Scheduler Details
* If the event is before the current time, the event will be highlighted green.
* If the event is between the current hour,  the event will be highlighted pink.
* If the event is past the current time, the event will be highlighted grey.
